    ran, and the reasoner returned an error. Retrying via the sync
    fallback path would re-run the same reasoner with the same input,
    burn the same budget, and produce the same failure — so the SDK's
    ``Agent.call`` skips the sync fallback when this is raised.

    Inherits from ``AgentFieldClientError`` for backward compatibility:
    callers that catch ``AgentFieldClientError`` still see this. New
    callers that want to distinguish "the work ran and failed" from
    "the call never reached the reasoner" should catch this directly.

    cancellation expresses *explicit user intent* to stop the work. The SDK's
    ``Agent.call`` must not silently re-issue a cancelled call via the sync
    fallback path — that would re-run work the user explicitly told the
    system to abandon.

    Intentionally NOT a subclass of ``AgentFieldClientError`` (the
    retry-eligible bucket): cancellation is never retry-eligible, regardless
